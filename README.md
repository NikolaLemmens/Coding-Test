# Unity Coding Test

Scenario Description: 

The app consists of 3 scenes. A timeline, that is visible at all time allows the user to navigate between these scenes and shows which scene the user is currently in. Transitioning between scenes should be seamless (no jumps). 

In ‘Scene-1’ a title fades in. 

In ‘Scene-2’ three spheres rotate around each other. The User can select any of the spheres. When pressing a sphere a transition will start: The remaining spheres fade out and the pressed sphere moves to the Center of ‘Scene-3’. 

‘Scene-3’ shows the selected Sphere with an additional GameObjects (can be anything) which fades in. A Button allows restarting at ‘Scene-1’.
